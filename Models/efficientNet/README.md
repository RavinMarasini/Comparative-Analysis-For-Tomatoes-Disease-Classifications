# Image Classification with EfficientNet

## Summary

This model uses the EfficientNetB0 baseline model as our entry point that takes in an input image with a 224x224x3 dimension. Computed class weight as the datasets are imbalanced. To find the best hyperparameter, keras tuner is used. Added dropout regularization to prevent overfitting while building model.
